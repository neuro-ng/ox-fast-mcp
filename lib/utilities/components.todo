# Python to OCaml Translation Notes and TODOs

## Python Imports and Their OCaml Equivalents

1. `from collections.abc import Sequence` - Not needed in OCaml as we use Core's built-in types
2. `from typing import Annotated, Any, TypeVar` - Not needed in OCaml due to its native type system
3. `from pydantic import BeforeValidator, Field, PrivateAttr` - Handled differently in OCaml:
   - BeforeValidator -> Handled through optional arguments in create function
   - Field -> Handled through OCaml record type system
   - PrivateAttr -> Handled through OCaml module system (private type)
4. `from typing_extensions import Self` - Not needed in OCaml due to its type system
5. `from fastmcp.utilities.types import FastMCPBaseModel` - Not needed as we implement directly

## Implementation Notes

1. Python's `_convert_set_default_none` function is not needed in OCaml as we handle this through:
   - Optional arguments in the create function
   - String.Set.empty as default value

2. Python's class inheritance from FastMCPBaseModel is replaced with a direct implementation
   in OCaml using records and module system.

3. Python's pydantic Field decorators are replaced with OCaml's type system and ppx derivers:
   - [@deriving compare, sexp, yojson] for serialization
   - [@sexp.option] and [@yojson_drop_default.equal] for optional fields

4. Python's PrivateAttr is implemented using OCaml's module system with the key field
   being part of the record but marked as optional.

## Missing Functionality

None - All core functionality has been implemented in OCaml with idiomatic patterns.
