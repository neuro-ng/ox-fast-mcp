# Logging Implementation Status

## Completed
[x] Create basic logging structure
[x] Implement Log_level module with proper comparison
[x] Implement Logger module with handler management
[x] Implement Log_handler interface and basic implementation
[x] Implement Log_formatter for message formatting
[x] Add Rich_handler for enhanced logging output
[x] Fix circular dependencies by creating Log_types module
[x] Fix level comparison and type issues
[x] Integrate with Async_log for actual logging
[x] Support different log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
[x] Fix format string and level handling in Log.Global calls
[x] Clean up module interfaces and remove unused code
[x] Add support for Logging.Global

## Missing ML Equivalents
[ ] Rich tracebacks (currently just using basic error printing)
[ ] Console module for rich output formatting (currently using basic eprintf)
[ ] Custom log handlers beyond basic and rich handlers
[ ] Log configuration from environment/config files
[ ] Log rotation and file output handlers
[ ] Structured logging with metadata/tags
[ ] Log filtering by module/component
[ ] Performance optimizations for high-volume logging

## Future Enhancements
[ ] Add support for async logging operations
[ ] Add support for log aggregation
[ ] Add support for log shipping to external services
[ ] Add support for log sampling
[ ] Add support for contextual logging (request ID, trace ID, etc.)
[ ] Add support for log formatting templates
[ ] Add support for log colorization
[ ] Add support for log buffering and batching

## Recent Changes
- Fixed format string usage in Log.Global calls
- Simplified log handler interface by removing unnecessary module type
- Fixed level comparison functions in Log_types
- Improved warning level handling in async logging
- Added proper handling for Critical level (mapping to Error in Async_log)
- Fixed unused variable warnings in logging configuration
