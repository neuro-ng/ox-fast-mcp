# HTTP Test Module TODOs

## Implementation Notes
- Using Jane Street's expect_test framework for testing
- Tests cover basic port availability and uniqueness
- Using Core_unix for socket operations in tests

## Test Coverage
Current coverage:
- ✓ Basic port number validation
- ✓ Port availability verification
- ✓ Unique port allocation

Potential additional tests to consider:
- Error handling for socket operations
- Concurrent port allocation testing
- Performance testing for multiple consecutive calls

## Python to OCaml Test Framework Mappings
- Python `unittest` → OCaml `expect_test_helpers_core`
- Python `self.assert*` → OCaml `[%test_result]` and `[%expect]`
- Python context managers → OCaml explicit resource management

## Additional Considerations
- Tests use Jane Street's sexp-based output validation
- Explicit port range validation (1-65535)
- Resource cleanup with explicit socket closure
- Non-deterministic port allocation handled appropriately in expect tests
