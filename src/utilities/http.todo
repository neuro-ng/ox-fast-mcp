# HTTP Utilities TODO

## COMPLETED
- [x] Resolved module name conflict between utilities/Http and server/Http
- [x] Renamed utilities/http.ml to network_utils.ml to avoid collision
- [x] Updated test/utilities/test_http.ml to use Network_utils module
- [x] Removed conflicting http.ml and http.mli from utilities
- [x] Verified build stability after module reorganization
- [x] All tests pass with new Network_utils module structure

## NOTES
- The original utilities/Http module contained only `find_available_port` function
- This has been moved to utilities/Network_utils to avoid naming conflicts with server/Http
- All tests now pass after this module reorganization

## PYTHON TO OCAML MAPPING
- Python: `http` module utilities → OCaml: `Network_utils` module
- Python: `find_available_port()` → OCaml: `Network_utils.find_available_port()`

## NEXT STEPS
- Consider adding more network utility functions to Network_utils if needed
- Document the module name change for users migrating from Python
